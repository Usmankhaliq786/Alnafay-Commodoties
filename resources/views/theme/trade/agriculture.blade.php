                        <h2>Wheat</h2>
                        <p>Wheat played a pivotal role in the social and cultural development of humanity, marking the
                            initiation of large-scale cultivation and long-term storage. This significant shift allowed
                            the establishment of city-based societies and laid the foundation for civilization.
                        </p>
                        <p>Originating as a wild grass in southwestern Asia, archaeological evidence suggests that wheat
                            cultivation began in the Nile Valley around 5,000 BC. While not native to the U.S., wheat
                            was first grown on the Massachusetts coast in 1602.</p>
                        <p>In commodity trading, wheat must be categorized into specific classes based on grain
                            properties defined by exchange contracts. One such class is Soft Red Winter Wheat, named for
                            its cultivation during U.S. winter months. Typically grown in humid environments like the
                            South, Great Lakes region, and the Atlantic coast, the planting season ranges from
                            mid-August to the end of October, with harvesting occurring in late May. Soft Red Winter
                            Wheat is a crucial ingredient for various food products, including bread, pasta, and
                            crackers, as well as industrial starches and adhesives.</p>
                        <p>Chicago Wheat futures offer an effective means to manage global price risks associated with
                            wheat trading for merchandisers, producers, food processors, livestock operations,
                            importers, and others. These futures contracts provide opportunities to identify cyclical
                            price and volatility patterns in both short and long-term scenarios.</p>
                        <p>Traders in Chicago Wheat futures can also capitalize on arbitrage and spread opportunities
                            with other commodities, including related grains, oilseeds, and livestock. Each Chicago
                            Wheat futures contract represents 5,000 bushels or approximately 136 metric tons.</p>

                        <h2>Corn</h2>
                        <p>Corn, belonging to the grass family, is a native grain of the Americas, with fossils of its
                            pollen dating back over 80,000 years discovered in lake sediment beneath Mexico City.
                        </p>
                        <p>Archaeological findings reveal that cultivated Corn existed in the southwestern U.S. for at
                            least 3,000 years, indicating its significance as a food crop among indigenous people well
                            before the arrival of Europeans.</p>
                        <p>As a resilient plant, Corn thrives in various regions worldwide, adapting to altitudes
                            ranging from sea level to 12,000 feet in the South American Andes Mountains. It can flourish
                            in tropical climates with high rainfall of up to 400 inches per year, as well as in arid
                            regions receiving only 12 inches per year. The U.S. stands out as a major Corn producer,
                            yielding a staggering 333 million tonnes, nearly three times more than the second-leading
                            country, China. Efficient large-scale Corn harvesting in North America emerged after World
                            War II, replacing labor-intensive methods.</p>
                        <p>Despite substantial domestic consumption in applications such as fodder and ethanol
                            production, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the country still exports
                            around 1,859 million bushels of Corn to other nations.</p>
                        <p>Corn finds primary use as livestock feed globally, with additional applications including
                            alcohol additives for gasoline, adhesives, cooking oil, margarine, sweeteners, and human
                            consumption. A single Corn futures contract represents 5,000 bushels or approximately 127
                            metric tons.</p>

                        <h2>Cotton</h2>
                        <p>Cotton, a natural plant fiber, originates from small trees and shrubs within the mallow
                            family, with the American Upland cotton plant being a common source.
                        </p>
                        <p>Utilized in India for over 5,000 years, Cotton has historical applications among ancient
                            Chinese, Egyptians, and North and South Americans. European settlers in the U.S. cultivated
                            Cotton as one of their earliest crops.</p>
                        <p>Thriving in regions with a long growing season, abundant sunshine, and water during growth,
                            Cotton necessitates dry weather for harvesting. The U.S. Cotton Belt extends from northern
                            Florida to North Carolina and westward to California.</p>
                        <p>Planting time in the U.S. varies from early February in Southern Texas to early June in the
                            northern Cotton Belt. The plant's flower bud evolves into an oval boil that opens upon
                            maturity. Mechanical harvesting, involving spindle-type pickers or strippers, is employed
                            for approximately 95% of U.S. Cotton, followed by processing at cotton gins for drying,
                            cleaning, separation, and baling.</p>
                        <p>Cotton finds diverse applications in products ranging from clothing and home furnishings to
                            medical items. Its value is assessed based on staple (fiber length), grade (color,
                            brightness, and foreign matter), and character (fiber diameter, strength, body, maturity,
                            uniformity, and smoothness). Cotton stands as the fifth-leading cash crop in the U.S. and a
                            significant agricultural export, with weight measured in pounds and price quoted in cents
                            and hundredths of a cent per pound. A "bale" is conventionally deemed to equal 480 pounds.
